Maven changes:
 - Repackage protobuf runtime dependency to prevent conflicts with clients'
   protobuf dependencies. Backwards-compatible, so no changes needed for clients
   who could use the previous release, but enables those with their own protobuf
   dependencies to use this and future releases without workarounds.
